Cleaned and visualized the 2019 general election dataset in Power BI, using DAX for advanced calculations and insights.
# Introduction
The 2019 Nigerian Presidential Election was held on 23 February 2019, marking the sixth quadrennial election since the return to democracy in 1999. Voters across Nigeria’s 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory participated to elect the President and members of the National Assembly. The election featured multiple political parties, with the major contenders being Muhammadu Buhari of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and Atiku Abubakar of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP).

This repository contains a cleaned dataset of the official election results, alongside interactive Power BI dashboards created to visualize voting patterns, turnout rates, and party performance. Using DAX calculations, the analysis provides insights into regional voting behavior, demographic influence, and comparative performance across states and geopolitical zones.

The goal is to make the data accessible, transparent, and easy to explore for researchers, analysts, and anyone interested in Nigeria’s electoral trends.
